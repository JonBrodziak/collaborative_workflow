# Developer process overview

In this section we will describe the process FIMS developers should follow when writing and checking in code.

## Developing a new feature

Start by creating a feature branch on Github...

To learn more about branches, see the ["About branches" section of the Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).

## Fixing a bug

## Opening a pull request
