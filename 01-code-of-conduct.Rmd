# Code of Conduct

## FIMS Contributor Conduct

All contributors participating and contributing to the FIMS project are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). Briefly, these standards are adopted to ensure a positive and harassment-free enviroment for all participants. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

## Ensuring Good Conduct

FIMS Community leaders will create default community health files (e.g. CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT) to be used in all repositories owned by FIMS. 

### Questions or Reporting Unacceptable Behavior

For questions about the FIMS Code of Conduct, or to report unacceptable behavior, contact the FIMS Community leaders at [INSERT FIMS EMAIL WHEN AVAILABLE]. All inquiries and reports will be reviewed promptly and fairly.
