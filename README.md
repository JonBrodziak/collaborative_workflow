# Collaborative workflow

Thank you for your interest in developing a collaborative workflow for FIMS.
First and foremost,
we would like to emphasize that all contributions are welcome and helpful.
Second,
we acknowledge the fact that guidelines are rarely static and
should reflect the behaviour that is desired.
Thus, the information posted here may change as FIMS develops and
participants learn from the greater open source software community.
Third, [GitHub](www.github.com)
will be the backbone of our collaborative efforts.
[GitHub's motto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests),
*collaboration without upfront coordination*,
is fitting given
(1) FIMS has already successfully employed GitHub without a formal workflow and
(2) over 31 million individuals are successfully using it to share their research.
We hope to put the GitHub motto to practice such that
all individuals wishing to contribute feel little barriers to doing so.

[Lowndes et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
remind us that

>engagement may best be approached as an evolution rather than as a revolution that may never come.

As we decide on an overarching workflow for FIMS,
we will also implement small incremental changes regarding the way
(1) communicate,
(2) document, and
(3) engage
while collaborating.
These small changes will help
(1) increase transparency,
(2) promote increased awareness, and
(3) reduce the overhead needed for communication.
For example,
Christine's efforts to ensure meeting notes are available in a document on google drive for each meeting
reduces overhead because people know exactly where to look for these notes and do not have to email Christine.

The crux of the workflow will be based on facilitating
**goal setting** and **quality control**,
which are important to the success of any project
(Balkundi and Harrison, 2006).
Goals will be complete when a pull request is accepted and the features are available in the main branch.
Quality assurance will come from code reviews initiated by pull requests.
Therefore,
**developing a workflow outlining best practices for pull requests is the main goal of the collaborative workflow repository**.

## GitHub workflow options

The flexibility offered within GitHub allows for projects to choose many workflows and
even switch back and forth between workflows.
All workflows stress code reviews as best practice.
Most projects settle on one of the following workflows:

  1. centralized:
  2. forks:
  3. branches:
  4. branches with main and development:
  5. gitflow
